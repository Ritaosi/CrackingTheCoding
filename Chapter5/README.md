# Chapter 5 Bit Manipulation

## Question One

**Insertion**: Given two 32-bit integers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and
j, write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit
i. Assume bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M.

    Example: N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
    Output: 10001001100

## Question Two

**Binary to String**: Given a real number between 0 and 1 that is passed in as a
double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented
accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR".
